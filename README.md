# automated_greenhous

The automated greenhouse regularly measures the humidity of the plants, the lighting conditions and the temperature in the greenhouse.
If these values exceed a threshold value, the plants are getting watered, aerated or the lighting is switched on.

So that you always know how much water is left in the tank from which the pumps take their water, the fill level is displayed with an LED.
All threshold values can be set with an OLED display and buttons.
